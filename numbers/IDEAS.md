repdigit types in base b, note that some factor trivially to another type
- repdigit AA..AA (b-1 types)
- near repdigit AA..AAB ((b-1)\*(b-2) types)
  - B=0 means it factors to b\*(repdigit AA..AA)
- near repdigit ABB..BB ((b-1)\*(b-2) types)
  - B=0 makes the entire number trivially factorable
- near repdigit AA..AABA ((b-1)\*(b-1) types)

method of constructing
- generate formulas for all near-repdigit type/forms
- factor as much from the terms as possible
- remove factors
